 This is my Github Main Page showing about me and my projects.



The page is divided into sections that you can navigate using the navigation bar.

It's divided into my video introduction, my portfolios/projects, about me, a form to contact me and the links to my social media, github account and my linked-in account.



I used Bootstrap CSS framework to make this page and jQuery for the animation of the navigation. The main text on the navigation bar is written in Javascript.

Installation
Download the Zip file on this link to get the files for my Main Page.

Roadmap
In the future this page will be updated into a more modern page and I will add more portfolios as I go into my class in MIT xPro.
